- The project “The Ultimate Quiz” is an interactive quiz with three different difficulty levels designed to test and enhance the participant’s knowledge.
- The project is provided the general instructions and specific instructions for each level (Easy, Moderate and Difficult). The project involves asking a series of questions with multiple-choice answers and determining the participant's score based on correct and incorrect responses. The participant needs to qualify for each level to progress to the next level. The final result and the option to receive a certificate are also included.

Library:-
- import sys
- “sys” library used to end the execution. The “sys.exit()” function is used to exit the program. It is useful when you want to terminate the program based on certain conditions.

Summary:-
- String function “lower()” is used to convert all the characters in a string to lowercase. It returns a new string with all alphabetic characters converted to lowercase, while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
- Then, “score +=1”,”score += 2” and “score+=4” is given to increment the score to the user according to the difficulty level of the quiz.
“score -= 0.5” and “score -=1” is given to decrease the score to the user according to the difficulty level of the quiz.
- To find the result and to calculate the final score of the quiz, ‘Percentage Formula’ is used as **“percentage = ((score / (total_score)) * 100)”**, here ‘total_score’ depends on the difficulty level of the quiz.
- At last to print the certificate “print statements” are used to output text, formatting and information to the user.
